Reuse if possible what i've done for nemesis project during march, it can morally enter in 1gam march.
What i've done, not much: coded ia base system, coded future display of world (this is cool :D)
For neon, I have to use neon colors, ok...
I have 10 days.

So ideas.
Moving neon colors
Player move a glowing spot light, it needs to get other glowing light which appears/move/disappear.
To Get light player has to play with RGB buttons to change its color according to the targeted light.
If same color it can take it.
It inversed, death?

Adventure game.
It could be nice to add a challenge to #1gam, make only adventure game, because this is what I want to do now.
So.
first to find a plot and others I will use mythic rpg system.
I cannot use dice where I am so first, create a myhtic pick system.
gogogo.
done!

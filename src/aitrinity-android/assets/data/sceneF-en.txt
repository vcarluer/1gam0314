I finally entered the main firewall 
But it was only an illusion 
IA trinity waiting for me, happy with their little game 
She asks me to choose, but only one can be 
One can help me 
The first says that she will be able to make me meet my ex 
The second claims that she could get rid of the FBI 
The third said she could make me rich 
Or I can choose not to choose 
So now what is my choice? 
Love, security or money?
